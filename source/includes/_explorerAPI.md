# Explorer API 

The QRL block explorer has been built with an API endpoint to enable an easy way for developers to grab data from the QRL blockchain. This endpoint is limited in scope and may change in future iterations of the explorer.


```
# Default response is in JSON format
# Append /text to the end of any request to get plain text response

https://explorer.theqrl.org/api/{REQUEST}/text
```

<aside class="success">
The Explore endpoint is reached at <a href="https://explorer.theqrl.org/">explorer.theQRL.org</a>. The API response can be either text or json depending on the developers needs. By default JSON is returned, simply append /text to the API query.
